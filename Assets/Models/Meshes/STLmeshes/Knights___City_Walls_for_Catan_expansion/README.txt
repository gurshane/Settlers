# Summary

These are some knights for the Settlers of Catan expansion "Cities and Knights". We lost some of our knights to a hungry dog and several of the knights I had seen on thingiverse were too complicated/fragile. These knights are very simple, with a "+" or an "o" for each strength level of the knight, and a small indent on the side for each strength level as well. The city walls are really just simple squares, just like in the real game. 

They're pretty small pieces so you might be able to get away without support, but I printed it with support just in case. I set infill to 30% and printed in black PLA. We colored in the "+" and "o" (different colors) to increase visibility.

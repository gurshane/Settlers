# Summary

This is the Donald Trump as Donald Duck, rescaled and put on a small plinth so he can serve as the robber for your Catan games (Settlers of Catan, if you've been playing it since the old days). This came about from some friends and I playing Catan and someone joking about the robber being Tump- and the name stuck. "Moving Trump" when someone rolled a 7 ended up being as much fun as the game itself.

So here I give you Donald the Robber Duck.

I managed to get this printed at the public library, but it was difficult. Failed three times. It's probably one of those pieces where you have to make two or three at a time, side by side, to give the filament time to cool.
